    "content": "If you spend as much time watching NBA highlights as I do, you’ve probably realized that the game has changed. It isn’t just about who can hit the most contested jumpers or who has the highest vertical anymore. Sports analytics has become one of the most important things when it comes to sports because it’s the only way to cut through the noise.\n\n### Step 1: Loading and Cleaning the Mess\n\nThe first part of our code is all about organization. We start by importing our tools and writing a function to open that JSON file.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef load_nba_data(file_path, season=2025):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:\n        data = json.load(f)\n    \n    rows = []\n    for p in data['players']:\n        name = p.get('name') or f\"{p.get('firstName', '')} {p.get('lastName', '')}\".strip()\n        # Filter for the correct season\n        for s in p.get('stats', []):\n            if s['season'] == season and not s['playoffs']:\n                rows.append({\n                    'Name': name,\n                    'Points': s['pts'],\n                    'Minutes': s['min']\n                })\n    return pd.DataFrame(rows)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Visualizing the Data\n\nNow that we have a clean table, we need to make it look good. Looking at a list of numbers is boring. We want to see trends.\n\n```python\ndef plot_nba_stats(df, stat_name):\n    # Calculate Per Game stats\n    per_game_col = f\"{stat_name} Per Game\"\n    df[per_game_col] = df[stat_name] / df['Games']\n    \n    top_10 = df.sort_values(by=per_game_col, ascending=False).head(10)\n    return top_10\n```\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. Once you get comfortable with Pandas and Matplotlib, you can start looking at \"True Shooting Percentage\" or \"Usage Rate.\" Let me know what kind of weird stats you find."

    "description": "A deep dive into the coaching carousel and competitive landscape of the NFC East heading into 2026, featuring insights on the Eagles, Commanders, Cowboys, and Giants.",
    "content": "Thank you to Ameya Idate for writing this article.\n\nAs the NFL regular season winds down, a strange silence has settled over the playoff bracket. For the first time since 2017, the postseason will not feature Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, or Joe Burrow. While most of the attention is on the Lombardi Trophy hunt, one division in particular stands out as a focal point for change: the NFC East.\n\n### The Philadelphia Eagles\nThey finished 11-6, but they are grappling with a sudden identity crisis. After losing offensive coordinator Kellen Moore to Kevin Patullo, the unit has regressed. Despite having **Saquon Barkley** and the elite receiving duo of **A.J. Brown** and **DeVonta Smith**, the run game essentially collapsed, losing nearly 40 percent of its rushing yardage per game.\n\n### The Washington Commanders\nComing off a disappointing 5-12 season, the organization is hitting the reset button. While head coach **Dan Quinn** remains, the team is parting ways with offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury and defensive coordinator Joe Witt Jr. This team is no longer just looking to compete; they are looking to prove they weren't one-hit wonders with **Jayden Daniels**.\n\n### The Dallas Cowboys\nThe Cowboys continue to be the league's mark of mediocrity, finishing 7-9-1. Statistically, Dallas has one of the best offenses, ranking 1st in yards per game with **Dak Prescott** and **George Pickens**. However, the defense lacked stability, leading to the firing of defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus.\n\n### The New York Giants\nNew York moved on from head coach Brian Daboll midseason. After losing **Malik Nabers** and **Cam Skattebo** to injuries, the team fell off. However, rookie quarterback **Jaxon Dart** exceeded all expectations, and **Abdul Carter** emerged as a promising edge rusher. With a top 5 draft pick on the way, the pieces are there for a quick turnaround."

    "description": "An exploration of why raw scoring isn't everything in the NBA. Comparing the offensive gravity of stars like Zach LaVine to the 'glue' impact of role players.",
    "content": "Imagine you are an NBA general manager and you have to choose between two players. Player A averages 20 points; Player B averages 10 points. If you look at the box score, Player A is the one getting the headlines. But if you look at the win column, everything flips.\n\n### The Case for Efficiency\nIn the 2023 season, **Zach LaVine** often saw the Bulls play better while he was on the bench, carrying a negative 18.8 On/Off rating. Meanwhile, **Alex Caruso** was the heartbeat of the team, maintaining a positive net rating with almost every teammate he shared the floor with.\n\n### The Engine Problem\nThe 2021 Brooklyn Nets are the ultimate cautionary tale. Having **Kevin Durant**, **James Harden**, and **Kyrie Irving** seemed like a cheat code. The problem is that a basketball game only has one ball. When you have three players who all need a 30 percent usage rate, you reach diminishing returns.\n\n### The Glue Guys\nCompare the Nets to the 2021 Milwaukee Bucks. They replaced Eric Bledsoe with **Jrue Holiday**. While Holiday's raw scoring numbers weren't always massive, his defensive presence was suffocating. He won possession after possession on the margins. Analytics has taught us that surrounding a superstar like **Giannis** with hyper-efficient connectors is more valuable than adding a second high-volume, low-defense scorer."
